## Vocal Tract Segmentation Project

**Speech articulation** is an extremely complex motor activity that requires the precise coordination of multiple muscles, governed by a neural network of cortical and subcortical structures. Alterations in this process, known as **motor speech impairments**, can be among the first symptoms of **neurodegenerative diseases**, such as **non fluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA)**. These impairments primarily manifest as apraxia of speech (AOS), characterized by **inconsistent speech patterns**, **distortions of consonants and vowels**, and **alterations in prosody and rhythm**, or as **dysarthria**, which presents more regular patterns but includes motor execution difficulties, such as slowness, imprecision, or muscle weakness affecting voice quality and speech clarity.

Currently diagnosis relies on subjective expert evaluations, but new technologies like **dynamic speech MRI** (dsMRI) provide real-time, non-invasive visualization of vocal tract dynamics. Recent advancements in high temporal resolution MRI sequences could revolutionize both the diagnosis and monitoring of these disorders, making analysis more objective and precise. The aim of our project is to develop **automatic segmentation** of vocal tract articulators in dsMRI images with **Salt & Pepper noise**, an **Improved U-Net** neural network to ensure accuracy and robustness even under degraded data conditions.
